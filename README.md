# You are Welcome to Get On the Bus

Team Get on the Bus is comprised of a diverse group of San Antonio locals who share the belief that public transportation is an important part of the infrastructure of a vibrant and growing city. 

San Antonio is growing rapidly; if we want to avoid traffic and parking growing pains like we have seen in other major Texas cities, if we want to increase diversity in ridership, if we want to close the accessibility gap caused by income disparity, we must build and attract people to public transportation. 

Our efforts include diving into the demographic makeup of VIAâ€™s riders, seeking opportunities for performance improvement, and finding possibilities to expand service to economically disadvantaged residents of Bexar County.

Our benchmarks for success in public transit include increases in ridership, solid performance and reliability, and service that is accessible to all in the community.

We combined VIA's Civtech datasets and census data to create maps combining VIA bus service performance and accessibility with racial and socio-economic profiles.
